# Project Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the Review Rating Model project. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the project's pipelines, API, and various documentation cards.

## Key Components

### Pipelines

The project consists of two main pipelines:

1. [**Data Processing Pipeline**](pipelines/data_processing.qmd)
   - Handles data splitting and preparation
   - Uses RoBERTa tokenizer for text processing

2. [**Data Science Pipeline**](pipelines/data_science.qmd)
   - Trains RoBERTa-based classification model
   - Performs model evaluation

### [Deployment API Documentation](api/server.qmd)

The model is served through a FastAPI application that provides:

- Real-time prediction endpoints
- Batch prediction capabilities
- Logging and monitoring features

### Documentation Cards

The project maintains three types of documentation cards:

1. [**Project Card**](cards/project_card.ipynb): Overall project information and metadata
2. [**Data Card**](cards/data_card.ipynb): Dataset characteristics and quality metrics
3. [**Model Card**](cards/model_card.ipynb): Model specifications and performance metrics

## Getting Started

To get started with the documentation:

1. Browse through the pipeline documentation to understand the data flow
2. Check the API documentation for integration details
3. Review the cards for detailed specifications about different aspects of the project
